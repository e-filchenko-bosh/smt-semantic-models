# Semantic Models


This repository is for semantic models based on the [ESMF](https://eclipse-esmf.github.io/esmf-documentation/index.html) [Semantic Aspect Meta Model (SAMM)](https://eclipse-esmf.github.io/samm-specification) .

There are differnt ways how to create and use these Aspect Models in [Submodel Template Specifications](https://github.com/admin-shell-io/submodel-templates):

* They are used as master of the semantic definitions used in the so-called "Semantic Drived workflow" as desribed in [HOW TO CREATE A SUBMODEL TEMPLATE
SPECIFICATION](https://industrialdigitaltwin.org/en/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/12/I40-IDTA-WS-Process-How-to-write-a-SMT-FINAL-.pdf)
* They are created on basis of an existing Submodel Template Specification
* They are build parallel to a Submodel Template Specification using a different workflow or using different semantic definitions as master
* They are build for reuse but no Submodel Template Specification is existing for these


[Best practices](https://eclipse-esmf.github.io/samm-specification/snapshot/appendix/best-practices.html) as defined in the SAMM specification should be followed.

When creating an Aspect Model for an existing Submodel Template Specification it is recommended to use the predefined Characteristics in [io.admin-shell.idta.shared](https://github.com/admin-shell-io/smt-semantic-models/tree/main/io.admin-shell.idta.shared) to ensure that [Value-Only](https://industrialdigitaltwin.io/aas-specifications/IDTA-01001/v3.1.2/mappings/mappings.html#value-only-serialization-in-json)  format of AAS is identical to the  [payload](https://eclipse-esmf.github.io/samm-specification/snapshot/payloads.html) as defined by SAMM.

The Aspect Models defined in this repository belong to the [namespaces](https://eclipse-esmf.github.io/samm-specification/snapshot/namespaces.html) starting with *io.admin-shell.idta*.


Models can reuse elements from different namespaces within the repository.

When defining and reusing elements from other aspect models, the following repositories with aspect models are allowed to be used besides the ones in this repository:

* [Catena-X aspect models](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sldt-semantic-models), their namespaces start with *io.catenax*
* [BatteryPass aspect models](https://github.com/batterypass/BatteryPassDataModel), their namespaces start with *io.BatteryPass* - however, please note that older version of these aspect models have licence **CC BY-NC 4.0**, only use Aspect Models with licence **CC BY 4.0**


# Generator used

The following [CLI - Semantic Aspect Meta Model Command Line Tool](https://eclipse-esmf.github.io/esmf-developer-guide/tooling-guide/samm-cli.html) was used for

* validating the aspect models
* for generating the different files in folder "gen"

>   ***-schema.json**  JSON schema for [Value-Only](https://industrialdigitaltwin.io/aas-specifications/IDTA-01001/v3.1.2/mappings/mappings.html#value-only-serialization-in-json) format of AAS
> 
>   ***.json**  example payload in [Value-Only format](https://industrialdigitaltwin.io/aas-specifications/IDTA-01001/v3.1/mappings/mappings.html#value-only-serialization-in-json) conformant to generated schema *-schema.json*
> 
>   ***.html**  hmtl documentation of the Aspect Model

The corresponding commands with **%1** being the .ttl with the Aspect Model and **%2** is the name of the file, typically the name of the Aspect Model, are

>samm aspect %1 validate
>
>samm aspect %1 to json --output "../_gen/%2.json"
>
> samm aspect %1 to schema  --output "../_gen/%2-schema.json"
>
> samm aspect %1 to html --output "../_gen/%2.html"


For creation of an .aasx file as preparation for the creation of a Submodel Template Specification the following commands are useful:
>
> samm aspect %1 to aas --format aasx --output "../_gen/%2.aasx"
>
> samm aspect %1 to aas --format json --output "../_gen/%2.aas.json"
>
> samm aspect %1 to aas --output "../_gen/%2.aas.xml"

The following version of the **samm-cli - Semantic Aspect Meta Model Command Line Tool** was used for validation and generation:
